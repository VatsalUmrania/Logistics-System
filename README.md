## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (latest LTS version recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Git

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VatsalUmrania/Logistics-System.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```bash
   cd Logistics-System
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend  
   *(Assume the repo is structured with `/frontend` and `/backend` folders. Adjust if different.)*

   **Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

   **Backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the backend server (runs on port 5000)
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   The backend should now be running at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

5. Start the frontend development server (in a separate terminal, from `/frontend`)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and make API requests to the backend.
